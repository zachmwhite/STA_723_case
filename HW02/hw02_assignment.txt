Power analysis:

You are asked to help design a new study on the factors that affect well-switching, sampling from a population that similar to the sample you analyzed in the FYE. In particular, assume you primary interest is to investigate the effect of distance from the well (scale: 20 meters) on well switching controlled for education and arsenic level using a logistic model. Provide a power analysis (also known as sample size calculation) with type I error fixed at 0.05 – present your result in a graph, as the standard in power analysis.  

If you do not know the concept of power analysis, use all online resources to look up. There are different ways of doing a power analysis; choose and implement one approach and discuss limitations and extensions. This is an individual assignment. We will randomly pick four students to present your approach in class.

Note: as a statistician, particularly in academia, power analysis is probably one of the most common requests you will get from collaborators or clients in practice. Most of the time, closed-form formula does not exist. 

Gameplan
Figure out how to draw from the distributions relatively well. 
association = rbinom(1, 1,p)
education = this will be a little bit more complicated
arsenic = I'm sure I can figure out some gamma distribution that will be good enough approximation

distance = Here we manufacture the data.  I'm thinking start with a uniform draw from the values that we have.

So the process

Do this all in a loop.  As repeititions go up 

Randomly draw a value from education = multinomial from the empirical averages and stuff
Randomly draw a value from association = rbinom with the empirical p
Randomly draw arsenic = create some gamma distribution that is similar to it 
Choose a starting value for the distance.  Start incrementing them by 20 like described
Choose sample size
N = test sample size
n = floor(Divide N / (length(seq(starting.value,max(distance),by = 20))))
modulo
repeat the variable sets n times. plus the modulo of the first times

generate N responses using r binom from the rates
Fit the model
Find the coefficients that are less that .05
Calculate model deviance
Calculate the significants

for the effect power for each of the variables
sum of the significant / number of repetitions

Bootstrap

Scale Data
Find MLE values

n = sample size
Figure out efect size. 5 different valuse I would say
draw n of the data points with replacement
Fix the coefficients.  The variables not of interest with their MLE's
Fix the coefficient of interest with their effect size
Fit glm
Test if it was significant
REpeat it again for multiple iterations.  That's how we actually get the power

So we will need to do some nested for loops.  
Initial round = bigger jumps. like seq(100,5000, by = 100)
Fewer number of repititons


Limititations .  We already have the data
