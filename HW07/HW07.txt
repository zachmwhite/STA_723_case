This is an individual assignment. This assignment has two components (the dataset are only slightly different, in fact the outcome variable of component 1 is created from component 2):

Component 1: Work on the take home problem of FYE 2013. It is important to understand the goal of this particular problem (prediction or estimation), which will dictate the methods used.

Right Heart Catheterization (RHC) is a procedure for directly measuring how well the heart is pumping blood to the lungs. RHC is often applied to critically ill patients for directing immediate and subsequent treatment. However, administering RHC may cause serious complications, though the risks are usually small. There is some debate whether the use of RHC actually leads to improved treatment.

The data set “rhc_study” (more information below) contains data on 3824 hospitalized adult patients at five medical centers in the U.S. The variable rhc (column 1) indicates whether RHC was applied within 24 hours of admission (TRUE/FALSE). Each patient was followed up with some treatment procedures that may have been influenced by the RHC result if it was performed on the patient. The outcome variable is surv30 (column 54) which is a prognosis score describing the probability of survival at 30 days after completion of treatment. The prognosis score derivation is a standardized procedure and is calculated by following the same protocol for all patients at all centers. Based on information from a panel of experts, a set of 52 variables were identified that are potentially related to both the decision to use RHC and the outcome surv30.

An accompanying data set “rhc_new” contains information on 1911 “new” patients admitted to the same five centers for serious health complications similar to the patients in rhc_study. These new patients are to be treated upon, with or without RHC being used to determine the choice of treatment. The data set rhc_new has the same 54 columns as rhc_study, but its column 1 and column 54 contain only NA’s.

Present a three page (maximum) report addressing the question: Should RHC be performed to assist treatment choices for new patients in order to maximize their individual prognosis scores? Your report should discuss all relevant aspects of your analysis (exploratory, modeling and validation) with graphical and numerical summaries that are important for communicating results. The report should be written so that doctors could understand and apply the findings while making RHC recommendation for future care. While you may include code and other plots in the supplemental appendix, you should not assume that graders will read beyond the main report; all relevant material should be within the three page limit.

You can access the two data sets in either tab delimited format (readable to R) or comma delimited ‘csv’ format (readable to Excel and R) from http://www.stat.duke.edu/~st118/fye13/takehome/. Details on all 54 variables are given on the next page.

Component 2: Work on the original dataset of the RHC data (5735 subjects total, with binary outcome (death at 30 days)) to answer the question: What is the average treatment effect of RHC for the treated group?  The dataset is attached.

Is this the atached data set?

Component 1 thoughts
Should RHC be performed to assist treatment choices for new patients in order to maximize their individual prognosis scores?

I'm still not sure how to do this.  There are two variables of interest here: prognosis score and rhc?

Basically, we want to see if the treatment is effective.
Possibility: Overall regression model.  Significant in prognosis score?  Yes.  Doing it like this, we are controlling for th other variables in a sense.  This seems too simplistic. 
Another possibility: Some propensity score to compare them.
Am I supposed to try to predict the new ones?  We don't have those values. 

Maybe try something bayesian.  What variables seem most important?  
Do Bayesian Variable selection.
Start with some normal variable selection?
Is this really acomplishing it

#################################################################################
Component 2 thoughts
This is a causal problem.  Currently, I don't know how to do causal stuff, but I can look that up and try to figure it out.

Average treatment effect of RHCfor the treated group.  Work this out.  Find propensity scores and do stuff like that?  How to do that?
The propensity scores are good.  I should have more now.

#################################################################################
PROGRESS

WHAT I DID
Propensity score for both
Predict whether or not RHC was used
Match the groups.
Plots comparing thegroups.
Use a t-test to compare the groups
SHould be pretty straighforward.

OTHER THOUGHTS
We know that under the simple linear regression model, it's significant, but that doesn't answer our question
Maybe ad some hieachy or a bayesian thing to compare.  Maybe with some hierarchy we could do it then?
I'm not sure about this part.

March 17, 2017
9-11
PART 2
Start with the first part.
For both parts, look at the model validation part
The models might be too complex.  Maybe take away some variables?
Should I fit another regression model?
I use neural networks?  Should I try a different model?  Would that impact it?
1-3
Figure out if what I'm doing is too complex.
Are propensity scores valid?  It does seem valid.
Average effect size?  This shouldn't be too bad.
PLOTS:
Propensity scores
model validation plots
Another regression model?
Exploratory plots

For the first 1
Use matching
Something to compensate for bias
Then use that model for the unobserved.
So we need to match the unobserved with the observed?
I'm trying to figure that out.

March 21, 2017
Listen to the presentations and figure out what is going on
What do I need to change?
Work on the unobserved
Find a way to compare that

Is the first part ATE? Average Treatment Effect
and the second is ATT? Average Treatment Effect on treated
###########################################################################
FROM CLASS, FROM FAN
With prediction. Use interactions? Each patient.  Heterogeneity across patients
Linear Model doesn't address a lot.
Interactions with treatment and other covariates
The main goal is the individual prediction =
We are assuming one model without any interactions.  We assume every person follows that main curve.  Really strong curve?
Subgroup detection.  Subclassification.  Treatment effect is higher.
We need individual prediction.  WHAT ABOUT UNCERTAINTY?
We need to be worried about the uncertainty.  It is really important
Heterogenity.  Uncertainty.  Outlier Detection.

COMPONENT 2
The assumptions for the Rubin Causal Model = The assumptions are reasonable
We do want the ATT
Do al of the variables = Super ad-hoc
Propensity Score = mehalonobis
Matching is intractable.
MatchIt = We are using propensity score matching.
Using Matching package
Do I need to do some weighting?  Go to her slides
USE THE CONFIDENCE INTERVALS

The matching is unreliable.  Bootstrap the variance to find the confidence interval

FOR MY STUFF
Better histograms in the beginning
use logit transformation on the probability
Shai uses BART, which helped with the heterogeneity.
If we use a Bayesian approach, a lot of the predicted will have a difference of zero on average, ut there will be subgroups where it is not.  THE SUBGROUPS ARE IMORTANT
Basic logistic regression.  Propensity score model.  Logistic Regression.  All the effects
5.9% sanity check.  I should certainly review this.
Also use the mean squared error
JIALIANG
Use the logit
Bayesian Model Averaging
Merlise's Package
Posteriors for it all.  without interactions.  Negative effect
Bayesian for uncertainty
He compared lasso and BMA
Take into account the interactions
We would use Bayesian Non-parametrcs with the interactions, but that seems crazy to me.
For 252 of the 1911 leads to improved treatment.  How did they do this?  I need to figure that out.

Component 2
Use the logistic with all the covariates
Balance check with the tengroups.  t-tests and ANOVA.
My numbers are totally wrong.  -0.0593 = ATE
-0.0581 ATT
Bootstrap for confidence intervals
For balance.  Each variable standardized difference.

KELLY
First 1.  Maybe don't use propensity score.  We are missing a lot of the data
Component 1 = the key is heterogeneity.  So throwing away is not good.
Prdouce prediction.  Uncertainty measurement will tell whether it's serious.
In the first component is purely predictive.
Creative = t-tests of the covariates
Most important.  Individual predictions.
I'm confused on whether or not they improve.  I need to work on that.

Component 2
Same thing with propensity scores

ISAAC
Component 1
Balance doesn't matter
Think about MSE
What does a Bayesian approach bring to causal inference.  Do something Bayesian.  Individual prediction with uncertainty quantification
Positive effect or not?  I'm really shaky on this prediction problem in the first part

Propensity score
Put that unbalanced covariate back into the value.

#################################################################
PLAN FOR MARCH 22
Logit transform
look for outliers
Plot of transform
Marginal Exploratory plots
Tables with differences
Fit OLS with all the terms
Maybe do some variable selection
Interaction with treatment
Basically we do double prediction almost, but we designate the value for treatment
We use mse.  Can we do predicted mean squared error? No
Take difference betwen treatment and control predictions.  Look at the histogram.
Try to analyze and look for subclasses
THIS IS ALL ABOUT PREDICTION

COMPONENT TWO
Propensity Score
Look at her slides!!!!!
Look at balance.
t-tests.
I need to reverse the response.  The values should be negative.
Figure out the interactions or just the overall model
Anova
Matching package
Bootstrap for the variance?  I'm not even sure how to do this, but we should report the confidence intervals.
I need to look at this stuff
