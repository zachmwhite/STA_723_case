The goal of this project is to evaluate the effects of the European
Central Bank's (ECB) Corporate Sector Purchase Programme (CSPP) on
firms' yields. The program has been conceived to help the financing
of European firms: Since the 2016 spring, ECB purchases all the
bonds issued by those firms with the Standard and Poor's credit
rating being above a threshold (BBB-). This allows firms to have
the possibility to be easily financed by a reliable investor such
as a central bank.

Here is a provisional dataset, where the key variables are:

ISIN: first two letter of the ISIN code of a firm. XS means international firms, others are single country firms.
        Normally there are less missing data for international firms.
Spread: the outcome
IG: the binary treatment (1: treated, i.e. ECB purchase; 0: control)
Effective.Rating..Launch: the Standard and Poor's credit rating, which determines the treatment variable
INTEXP.DEBTL: the ratio between INTEXP and DEBT, which from the economic point of view is the most predictive covariate
999999: missing data
Deal.Value.Euro..Face: the amount of money involved; the total is about 400 billions Euros

The following are pre-treatment variables (covariates):

TA2015: Total Assets. The final amount of all gross investments, cash and equivalents, receivables, and other assets

EBIT2015: earnings before interest and taxes
COMEQY2015: common equity (it is a definition of equity which only takes into account the common stockholders, and
            disregards the preferred stockholders)
LIAB2015: Liabilities.
REVEN2015: Revenues
INTEXP2015: Interest expenditure
DEBT2015: Total debts
NI2015: Net Income (net income is calculated by taking revenues and subtracting the costs of
        doing business such as depreciation, interest, taxes and other expenses)
CURRPORLTDEBT2015: current portion of long term debt (the total amount of long-term debt that
                     must be paid within the current year)
CASHFROMOPER2015: cash
LTDEBT2015: Long term debts

At least two issues need to be addressed. 
1. The first week we focus on: how to deal with the large proportion of missing data? For example, if you are thinking of multiple imputation, is the missing at random (MAR) assumption plausible? If you think so, why? If not, how do you address it?  Also how do you evaluate the quality of your imputation?
2. For the second week we  focus on: how to evaluate the effects of the CSPP?

Tidbits from EDA
####
Information for the individual banks
61% of the missing data comes from the bank XS
Doesn't seem random
90% of the missing data comes from three banks XS, FR, DE
Bank AT doesn't have any missing data
###
INDIVIDUAL VARIABLES
Variables with no missing data
ISIN, Issuer.Nationality.of.Operations, INvestiment.Grade, Callable..Y.N., Float..Y.N., Parent.Speicific.Indeustry.Group..SIG, Years.to.Maturity, Subordinated.Debt..Y.N, IG Effective.Rating.Lunch
There is less domination in the variables, and they're generally around .06-.08 

The packages won't work because it says that there are two columns that are identical and so they aren't working
Investment.Grade..Y.N. and IG have the same rank ordering

NOTE: The following pairs of variables appear to have the same missingness pattern.
 Please verify whether they are in fact logically distinct variables.
     [,1]       [,2]      
[1,] "TA2015"   "LIAB2015"
[2,] "TA2015"   "NI2015"  
[3,] "LIAB2015" "NI2015"

##############################
What we can do is assume a multivariate normal for all the responses that aren't categorical
Hierarchical Model with missingness by the bank
Use some sensitivity analysis

In the actual analysis a log transformation is probably appropriate

The missing indicator and the covariates/response must be modelled jointly

Two general approaches: Selection Models, Pattern Mixture Models
