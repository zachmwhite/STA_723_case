Take Home Question
A paper (citation omitted) reported on seven published studies on the question of whether chlorinated water is a risk factor for bladder cancer. Each of the primary studies is summarized below in Table 1 and (over the page) Table 2. Each study estimated an adjusted odds ratio that contrasted people who were exposed to chlorinated drinking water with people who drank mostly unchlorinated water. Each study reported an estimated odds ratio and 95% confidence interval adjusted for
one or more confounding variables.

Explore and analyze the data. Present your analysis results addressing the primary question: What is the evidence that chlorinated water is a risk factor for bladder cancer?

Your report should discuss all aspects of your analysis – exploratory and modeling – with relevant graphical and numerical summaries

Meta Analysis
Adjusted odds ratio
Estimated ods ratio
95% confidence interval adjusted for one or more confounding variables

Goals: What is the evidence that chlorinated water is a risk factor

There are 7 analyses = 4 of the confidence intervals include 1, which indicates non-significance

We don't have sample sizes
We need to create the weights probably = we just have quality scores
Since we're missing n, we can't get the variance with the confidence intervals
We have 95% confidence intervals.

Interpretation of summary output
I2 = How much of the total variability in the effect sie estimates can be attributed to heterogeneity
H2 = ratio of total amount of variability comes from within sample variation
